Installation

1) Run the "npm install” command in the terminal to install dependencies.
	-While developing this project I used Gulp to assist me with a few processes. I have included the package.json file so simply running the "npm install” command through the console will download the required dependencies.

2) There is a Gulp task set up to watch the sass file and log any errors in the console.
	-You can run this task by navigating into the project directory in your terminal and running the command “gulp” to start the default tasks I have put in place.
  
3) Open the index.html file with your browser.
	- From there you will be able to go through the entire workflow of selecting, uploading, and viewing the file you selected.
